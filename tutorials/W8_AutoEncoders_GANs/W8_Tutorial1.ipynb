Something sneaky is happening inside `rsample` which allows us to use Monte Carlo estimates of $\\mathbb{E}_{q(\\mathbf{z};\\phi)}[\\ldots]$ (as in the ELBO) but then take gradients of all of it with respect to $\\phi$. Inside the `torch.distributions` package, you'll find both `sample` and `rsample` functions. The key difference is that you can take gradients through `rsample` but not through `sample`. Magic! (The \"r\" in \"rsample\" stands for \"reparameterized sample\".)\n",
