### Question
Try with Bald feature; why it fails on women?

### Answer
Since bald women's occurrence is very rare in the dataset, the generator did not learn a disentangled representation of baldness, and it thinks it is a male characteristic. Hence often trying to turn women into bald comes with other male features.
