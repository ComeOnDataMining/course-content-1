# Exercise 6.3: Unscrambling with CycleGANs
How can we improve the results?

# Answer: 
Here are some ideas worth trying:
* Make it conditional
* Add a Sparse regularization to the generator
* Better initialization of the generator function
* Using an auto-encoder type for the generator
* Different loss functions for reconstruction and adversarial losses
